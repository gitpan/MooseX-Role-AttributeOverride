DESCRIPTION
    Moose doesn't allow roles to override attributes using the has '+attr'
    method. There are several good reasons for that. Basically, "that's not
    what a role is for." A role is a set of requirements with defaults. A
    class should always be able to override a role.

    But sometimes you want a role to add features to a class. This is why
    Moose has method modifiers. This extension adds attribute modifiers.

INTERFACE
    has_plus
        This has exactly the same syntax as the Moose has command, except
        you should not use a plus.

        One additional option is available, 'override_ignore_missing'.
        Setting this to a true value will allow your role to have
        modifications to attributes that may not exist in the class it is
        applied to. The default is to die in these cases.

DIAGNOSTICS
    Can't find attribute $attr required by $role
        You will see this error if your role has an attribute modification
        for an attribute that is not in the class. You can squash this by
        setting the 'override_ignore_missing' option in your 'has_plus'
        command.

    Attempt to call has_plus on an invalid object
        You really should never see this. Please file a bug report if you
        do. A test case would be nice as well.

    Illegal inherited options
        Moose will throw this error if you try to change an accessor option.
        See the Moose manual for more details.

    Do not use a plus prefix with the has_plus sugar
        There is no need for a plus sign on your attribute:

            # Good
            has 'children', trait => ['good']

            # Bad.  Will die
            has '+children', trait => ['naughty']

DEPENDENCIES
    Moose 1.9900 or newer. Older versions may be supported in a future
    version of this module.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    I am sure that there are some MooseX modules that will not work with
    this. Please let me know, and I will at least document them.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    This is not the intended use of roles. As a result, take into account
    the following:

    *   Order matters! If two roles modify the same attribute in the same
        way, the second one applied will be the one that is used. This
        behavior, however, relies on Moose keeping track of order, which it
        generally does a good job of, but no gurantees.

    *   Currently, the value of the attribute is clobbered when the role is
        applied. This may change in the future.

    *   This works the same as '+has'. This means that you can't override
        accessor methods. This is a very sensible Moose limitation.

    I am relativly new to Moose. I had an itch, and wrote this Module to
    scratch it. Please let me know how to make this module better.

    For bugs, test cases are great!
